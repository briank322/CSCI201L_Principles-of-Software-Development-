Assignment 1 covers the contact book Application(Java)
•	Creating a program that populates a contact book and allows the user to search and modify it.<br />
•	Parsing a file containing a set of contacts and their information.<br />
•	To ensure accurate parsing, you will then provide a command line interface to allow a user to query and modify the parsed data.<br />

Assignment 2 & 3 covers the Book Website.<br />
•	Created a website in HTML and JavaScript with an interaction requesting data from Google Books API. Showing search results by parsing JSON files. Unsuccessful query shows appropriate error message. <br />

Assignment 4 covers the Multi-Player & Networked Hangman Game <br />
• Built a multi-player, networked Hangman Game using Java and Agile (Scrum) methodology. Used Google Cloud SQL
database to store and retrieve login information. Server shows user history and game statistics.<br />
• Used Properties class in configuration file to make a connection between clients and the server. By implementing
multi-threading, the program allows users to create or join game rooms after logging in.<br />
